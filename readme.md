# TransL
A Discord bot that allows people from all over the world to communicate!  
It uses the excellent [DeepL Translator](https://deepl.com) for maximum translation accuracy.

## Features
TransL is designed so that all the text in your server is in the same language.
You can set your preferred server language through a command, and all messages will – by default – be translated into it.

If a message happens to be written in a wrong language, you can right-click it and translate it for yourself after the fact.

All commands, parameters, options, etc. are available in all Discord-supported languages, so users can always read them.
They all are shown in different languages depending on what language a user has selected in their Discord settings.
